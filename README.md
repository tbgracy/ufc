# üî• Ultimate Frontend Challenge üî•

## üìù Description

A weekly frontend challenge host website to improve your skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## ü§î Why UFC?

Me and some friends wanted to practice our frontend coding skills and decide
to take one design to life every week. Along that, we needed an automatic accountability
system that could also motivate us to give our best. So I thought of a website were we can
browse all participant's entries and eventually vote for one. It was also a good opportunity for
me to practice and learn React at the same time.

## üôã How to participate?

- **Step 1 :** Go [here](https://ultimate-frontend-challenge.netlify.app). Login with your github account.

- **Step 2 :** Go [here](https://github.com/lucazh/UFC-topic) to see the current challenge.

- **Step 3 :** Create a repository with `ufc` in it's name so the repository will automatically be added to the website.

    - Example : `ufc-w1-my-first-entry` stand for "Ultimate frontend challenge - week one - first - entry"


You need to host your code on github pages(`recommended`) or any other host provider(vercel, netfly,...) to be able to see it on the website and provide the **url** of your hosted website in the **about** section so it can be previewed on the home page.

## ü§ù How to contribute?

You can contribute by doing some of the undone todo items in [the last section](#todo), or make some improvements, whether it's features or design.
